% intro to results
This chapter presents the results of the thesis.
The results are divided into three parts: an initial qualitative analysis of the spectra, followed by the performance parameters of the setup and acquisition parameters, and finally the quantification results.
As seen in the SE images presented in \cref{method:SE_images}, the areas chosen for the analysis are homogeneous and relatively clean.
Scratched areas on the GaSb specimen are shown in \cref{fig:SE_images:GaSb} panel (b), where some spectra were acquired, but not included in the results of this thesis.
% DONE discuss: the scratched areas behaved as expected, yielding poorer results than the homogeneous areas. ISO etc.

\section{Qualitative analysis}
\label{results:qualitative_analysis}

Here, an overview of the spectra is presented, where some characteristics and artifacts are identified.
General plots of the spectra are given in \cref{fig:results:overviewGaSb_withArtifacts,fig:results:GaSb_voltages,fig:results:GaAs_voltages}.

The lines given in \cref{tab:theory:lineEnergies} for Ga, As, and Sb have been identified in the spectra.
All spectra also had a peak at C K$\alpha$.
% DONE Ton: discus this C_Ka artifact, origin, in discussions
% DONE Ton: No other common peaks like Fe, or Si from setup?
The GaSb spectra included a well-defined O K$\alpha$ peak, while the GaAs spectra had barely any signal from the O K$\alpha$ line.
% DONE discuss: the O Ka peak might also be a Sb M-line, but I have not found the energy of the Sb M-lines.
As annotated in \cref{fig:results:overviewGaSb_withArtifacts}, the GaSb spectra also included two Sb M-signals: $\eta$ and $\gamma$, where $\eta$ is a clearly defined peak, while $\gamma$ is a slight increase in intensity.
These two M-peaks are not listed in the HyperSpy database, but were found through AZtec \cite{aztec_manual} and other literature \cite{liao2006practical}.
% DONE discuss: M lines are present in the absorption plot of GaSb



% \subsection*{Artifacts}

Artifacts are present in all spectra, in varying degrees.
The artifacts identified are listed and described in \cref{tab:results:artifacts}.
The artifacts present in the spectra are the background, the noise peak, the carbon and oxygen stray peak, coincidence peaks, the internal Si fluorescence peak, and the Si escape peak from Sb La.

% The background is present in all spectra, and with increasing background intensity with higher count rates.
% The effect of a strong absorption edge which reduce the background intensity above its energy is most prominent in the GaAs spectra.
% Here it is the absorption edge in the L-peaks which reduce the background intensity abruptly above the L-peaks.
% Coincidence peaks are only present in some spectra, and are most prominent in the spectra with very high count rates.
% The spectra with beam energy 5, 10, and 15 keV also show coincidence events above $E_0$, e.g. visible in panel (a) in \cref{fig:results:GaSb_voltages}.

% 2 setup
\section{EDS performance parameters}
\label{results:performance}
% TODO: re-read, as the two sections are now merged

The performance parameters of the EDS system are directed towards the setup and the acquisition parameters.
The metrics are the energy resolution, the energy scale and offset, the peak ratios, the deviations in peak positions, the Duane-Hunt limit, the Fiori peak-to-background ratio.
Additionally, results from the user parameters process time, beam energy, and beam current are presented.
% The parameters of the setup are: energy resolution, the energy scale and offset, peak ratios, and deviations in peak positions.
To show how the info in a single spectrum varies with the selected line of reference, information from the lines are presented from two selected spectra in \cref{tab:results:lines_info_30kV_50pA}.
The two selected spectra are both acquired with 30 kV, 50 pA, PT 6, DT 44\%, and ICR = 17k cps for GaSb and ICR = 16.5k cps for GaAs.
The table lists the theoretical energy of the line, the change in position after calibration, the FWHM of the peak, the area of the peak, the Fiori P/B of the line, and the estimated FWHM of Mn K$\alpha$ using \cref{eq:estimateFWHM}.


\input{tables/results/table_lines_info.tex}


\subsection{Energy resolution} % of the detector}
\label{results:energy_resolution}

The energy resolution, as the estimated FWHM of the Mn K$\alpha$ peak, is both a function of the detector and certain acquisition parameters.
The energy resolution should not be a function of the specimen, but as it is calculated with \cref{eq:estimateFWHM}, the outputted number depends somewhat on the peaks in the spectrum.
This is shown in \cref{tab:results:lines_info_30kV_50pA}, where the highest and lowest estimated energy resolution is 123 eV and 135 in the GaAs spectrum, and 121 eV and 133 eV in the GaSb spectrum.
The energy resolutions, calculated through HyperSpy, are listed for all spectra in \cref{tab:results:energy_resolutions}, with the relevant acquisition parameters.
In the GaSb spectra the best energy resolution was 124 eV, obtained with PT 6, ICR = 22k cps, $E_0$ = 15 kV, and $i_b$ = 200 pA.
In the GaAs spectra the best energy resolution was 127 eV, obtained with PT 6, ICR = 880 cps, $E_0$ = 5 kV, and $i_b$ = 25 pA.
% DONE discuss: no obvious relation between the two best energy resolutions. But, it depends on the peaks in the spectrum.
% The best energy resolution obtained was: 124 eV for the GaSb spectra with PT 6, and 127 eV for the GaAs spectra.
% DONE discuss: Different peaks are used in GaSb and GaAs, thus we get different number with equal acquisition parameters.
% DONE discuss: Ga Kb gives the lowest, which might be a result of the overlap with As Ka.
These numbers for the energy resolution is calculated with HyperSpy, which have an issue explained in \cref{theory:eds_performance:energyres}.
As \cref{tab:results:energy_resolutions} shows, the energy resolution is affected by the two acquisition parameters: (i) process time and (ii) input count rate.
The ICR change with $E_0$ and $i_b$.
Specifying a single energy resolution for the detector should be accompanied by the acquisition parameters used to obtain that energy resolution.
Preferably, the value should also be an average with an uncertainty, calculated by several measurements with equal acquisition parameters.
This is not done here, but the values in \cref{tab:results:energy_resolutions} show that PT 6 give the best energy resolution at about 127 $\pm$ 2 eV.
When \cref{tab:results:lines_info_30kV_50pA} with the variations based on the peak of reference is taken into account, the energy resolution is more like 127 $\pm$ 6 eV.
% DONE discuss: The energy resolution is more like +- 6 eV, when we take into account the variations when using different peaks.



\input{tables/results/table_energy_res_GaSb_GaAs.tex}


\subsection{Scale, offset, and peak position deviations}
\label{results:scaleoffset}

The energy scale and offset are the parameters which are used to calibrate the spectra.
Both metrics are quite consistent between the spectra, and the energy scale match with the setting used in the acquisition (10 eV per channel).
The averaged values and the standard deviations are listed in \cref{tab:results:scale_offset}.
The calculated scale of the detector is equal to the instrument setting at 10 eV per channel, with very low standard deviation between the spectra at 0.04 eV/channel.
The zero offset was calculated to be -0.205 keV, which is a deviation of half a channel from the instrument setting of -0.2 keV.
The standard deviation of the offset is 0.004 keV.

% DONE discuss: Comment that the std of the offset is one order of magnitude closer to the avg compared to the std vs avg of the scale.
% DONE discuss: why GaSb is slightly better std, might be because of the lines but also the higher i_b which gives more counts.


% \subsection{Deviations in peak positions}
% \label{results:peak_positions}

No significant deviations in peak positions were observed.
The maximum deviation was 2 eV, and the minimum deviation was -2 eV, which is very low compared to the energy of the lines which are > 1 keV.

% DONE discuss: The maximum deviation was 2 eV, and the minimum deviation was -2 eV, which is very low. Either very good spectra with a well calibrated detector, or something fishy with the HyperSpy calibration of the peaks.


\input{tables/results/table_scale_offset.tex}



\subsection{Peak ratios}
\label{results:peak_ratios}

The results from the peak ratios are listed in \cref{tab:results:peak_ratios}.
The peak ratios are useful to alert carbon contamination over time, and to identify and quantify stray radiation with certain sample geometry.
As the results are neither a series over time nor taken with the required sample geometry, the results in the table are a demonstration of the metric without any further interpretation.
Peak ratios are also used for quantification, but needs bulk corrections.
The table show that some peak ratios vary greatly with the acquisition parameters, e.g. the ratio between Ga L$\alpha$ and Sb L$\alpha$.


\input{tables/results/table_peak_ratios.tex}


% \brynjar{Eventually, take a new set of data to look at carbon contamination over time. Then make the table.}

% \brynjar{TODO: redo these results. From ton: "yes, think is good to do. What
%     would the advice be at the end? Take series or compare ratios for first and last
%     spectrum to exclude C-contamination? For discussion: How does the measured ratio
%     compare to the theoretical (quantum mechanics) ratio? And why?"}

% \section{Optimization of the acquisition parameters}

% The performance metrics of the acquisition are: the Duane-Hunt limit, the Fiori peak-to-background ratio, and portion of counts in peaks vs background.
% Additionally, results from the user parameters process time, beam energy, and beam current are presented.



\subsection{Process time}
\label{results:process_time}

One of the acquisition parameters which was tested was the process time.
The process time is a trade-off between the energy resolution and the throughput.
This effect is illustrated in \cref{fig:results:energy_resolutions_process_time}, which is a plot of the GaSb spectrum at minimum and maximum process time.
Both spectra are taken at 30 kV with 50 pA.
The figure have three panels, (a) for low, (b) for medium, and (c) for high energy X-rays.
The effect of the lowered energy resolution is most prominent for the low energy X-rays.
The difference between the observable center of the peaks and the theoretical line energies in panel (a) is due to the poorer calibration at sub 1 keV energies.
In panel (a), the Sb M$\eta$ and O K$\alpha$ are merged together with PT 1, but are separated with PT 6.
The ability to separate peaks is the definition of energy resolution, thus panel (a) is a good illustration of different energy resolutions.
The Ga L$l$ and Ga L$\alpha$ peaks are separated with PT 6, but are merged together with PT 1.
With PT 4 (not shown), the Ga L$l$ and Ga L$\alpha$ peaks still separated, but with PT 2 (not shown) they are merged together.
% TODO discuss: visible separable and separable with gaussian modelling is different. Visible separable is important for qualitative analysis. And the quantitative is probably better with more separated peaks, but overlapping can be dealt with quire well.
\cref{tab:results:energy_resolutions} show that the energy resolution with PT 1 is 158 eV, and with PT6 it is 127 eV.
In panel (b) with the medium energies, the contrast of the peaks are lowered, i.e. the difference between the top of the peaks and the valley between the peaks are lowered.
The effect of the lowered energy resolution is not as prominent panel (c) for high energy X-rays.

% TODO discuss: for high energies the peaks are also well separated.

The effect of the process time on the FWHM of the lines is shown in \cref{tab:results:PTvsFWHMs}.
The table shows the measured FWHM of Ga L$\alpha$, Sb L$\alpha$, and Ga K$\alpha$ for different process times.
The measurement is done on the Gaussian fit of the peaks.
Additionally, the FWHM of the Mn K$\alpha$ is estimated for each process time.
The table shows the variations on the GaSb specimen with PT 1, 2, 4, and 6.
The last row shows the FWHM in the GaAs specimen at PT 6 for reference.
All spectra in the table were acquired at 30 kV and 50 pA.
In the GaSb spectra, the PT 1 has DT 4\%, PT 2 has DT 7\%, PT 4 has DT 13\%, and PT 6 has DT 44\%.
The GaAs spectrum with PT 6 has DT 44\%.

% TODO discuss: based on the numbers, PT 4 should be good enough for most applications. High resolution, and much faster than PT 6. DT44 is really high, and not nice for mapping.
% TODO discuss: specimen with many L-lines


\input{tables/results/table_PTvsFWHMs.tex}


\subsection{Beam energy and beam current}
\label{results:beam_energy_and_beam_current}


% comment on (A) and (B)
The energy and the amount of electrons in the probe is important for the emerging X-ray spectrum.
Using a low overvoltage is both problematic for the qualitative and quantitative analysis.
The green line in \cref{fig:results:GaAs_voltages} is the 10 kV spectrum for GaAs, which has no visible signal from the Ga K$\alpha$ peak, where the overvoltage is around 1.1.
The overvoltage is also an issue for the Sb L-lines in the 5 kV spectrum in \cref{fig:results:GaSb_voltages}.
The Sb L-peaks are present, but weak, and the L$l$ peak is not visible.
This issue with the weak Sb-L peaks makes the quantification of Sb difficult at low voltages, as seen further down in \cref{results:initial_quantification}.
The GaAs specimen is quantified much more accurately at 5 kV, because the Ga L$\alpha$ and As L$\alpha$ peaks have similar overvoltages.
In the voltage series, which are group (A) and (B) in \cref{method:acquisition_settings}, the amount of counts in the lower voltages are quite low.
The low amount of counts is due to keeping the beam current constant at 50 and 25 pA.
Using a higher beam current on the lower energies would have made normalization more necessary, which is adding a layer of subjective decisions as the spectra must be normalized to something.
% DONE discuss: this might not have been the best choice. For future work one can try to get the same ICR for all voltages, and see if the results are better and still comparable, without normalization.
Even though the 30 kV spectra in GaAs and GaSb have more counts and are smoother than the other spectra, they both have more artifacts.
% DONE discuss: the amount of artifacts have to be adjusted for the specimen and the goal of the analysis.
Around 1 keV, the 30 kV and 15 kV spectra are quite similar.
% DONE discuss: at 1 keV, the ionization cross section when using 15 or 30 kV is more or less the same.

% \brynjar{TODO: write something about ICR?}

% (C) (D) and (E)
As the 30 and 15 kV spectra gave better results for GaSb, they were chosen for group (C) and (D).
In (C) different process times were tested, and these results are presented in \cref{results:process_time}.
In (D) different beam currents were tested, while also changing the PT and $E_0$.
% In (E) the data type maps were acquired.
% (D)
The combination of high $i_b$ and high PT in two of the spectra in (D) made the DT very high.
Despite the high DT, the amount of artifacts in the 200 pA and 400 pA spectra were similar to the 50 pA spectra.
However, with DT at 53\% and 77\%, the acquisition time was very long.
% TODO discuss: DT is not a good measure of the artifacts, at least not when using high PT which allows the electronics to count accurately. However, high i_b and PT is bad for mapping.
On the quantification presented in \cref{results:initial_quantification}, the beam energy appears to be more important than the beam current.
% TODO discuss: this might be a result of the lines used (Ga L or Ga K).








\subsection{Duane-Hunt limit}
\label{results:duane_hunt}

The Duane-Hunt limits, or the effective beam energies, are presented in \cref{tab:results:duane_hunt}.
The table shows the Duane-Hunt limit for the 5, 10, and 15 kV spectra.
As the energy range recorded in the spectra were 0-20 keV, the Duane-Hunt limit of the 30 kV spectra were not possible to calculate.
All the calculated Duane-Hunt limits are within 0.2 keV of the nominal beam energy, i.e. the specified beam energy in the SEM software.
The average deviation is 0.06 keV, with a standard deviation of 0.04 keV.
This shows that the beam energy is quite stable.
% TODO discuss: the usefulness of calculating the DH limit.

\input{{tables/results/table_duane_hunt.tex}}




\subsection{Fiori P/B ratio}
\label{results:fiori}

The Fiori numbers are presented in \cref{tab:results:fiori}, with the Fiori P/B ratio in the five rightmost columns.
% # for Ga La, Ga Ka, As La, Sb La, Sb Lb
The ratios are for the Ga L$\alpha$, Ga K$\alpha$, As L$\alpha$, Sb L$\alpha$, and Sb L$\beta$.
The Fiori P/B ratios have a spread between just below 100 to right under 800.
The overall highest ratio is for the Ga K$\alpha$ peak for the 30 kV and 25 pA GaAs spectrum, with a ratio of 770.
% DONE discuss: repeat why the numbers are so high. That is dividing by one single bg channel, which makes the ratio unaffected by energy resolution.
The equal settings in the GaSb spectrum have a ratio of 408 for the Ga K$\alpha$ peak.
For the Ga K$\alpha$ peaks, the GaAs spectrum have almost twice as high Fiori P/B ratios as the GaSb spectrum.
The Ga L$\alpha$ peak is present in all the spectra, and it can be used for comparison.
% The background counts around the Ga L$\alpha$ peak is around 2-5 times higher in the GaSb spectra than in the GaAs spectra, which is reflected in the different Fiori ratios for the Ga L$\alpha$ peak.
% DONE sort of discuss: the mu_rho of GaAs is much higher than GaSb above 1 keV because of the double absorption edge. This gives a much higher Fiori ratio for GaAs than GaSb, as the background is lower. But the Ga_La peak ing GaAs is also higher. The specimen dependness is high.
The tabulated data indicate that $E_0$ has the largest impact on the Fiori P/B ratio.
The peak height between GaAs and GaSb differs some, but it is probably the background levels which make the biggest impact on the Fiori P/B ratios.
For the Ga L$\alpha$ peak, the Fiori P/B ratios is up to 6 times higher for GaAs than GaSb.
This shows clearly that the Fiori P/B ratio is specimen dependent, even when using the same peak and setting.

\section{Quantitative analysis}
\label{results:quantitative}


% \brynjar{TODO: more intro?}

% DONE say that the average, >10%, and <5% are in tables here, while all the compositions are in the appendix.
This section presents the results from the quantitative analysis, using different correction methods. 
With 15 spectra analyzed, the tables are large and average values are used to get an overview of the results.
The results from all the spectra in the initial quantification are shown in \cref{results:initial_quantification}.
For this and the remaining methods, a table with the average values, deviations above 10 at\%, and deviations below 5 at\% are shown.
The 5 kV GaSb spectrum is excluded from these average tables, as the spectrum had several issues.
% TODO discuss: say why the 5 kV GaSb spectrum is excluded from the average tables.
The full tables with quantification using the thin film assumption, the ZAF absorption correction, and corrections with PAP are given in \hyperref[appendix:tables]{Appendix C}.


\subsection{Initial quantification}
\label{results:initial_quantification}

% initial quantification (AZtec and i/i_sum)
Initial quantification was done with the AZtec software and with the uncorrected intensity ratio method.
The intensity ratio method gives relative compositions, and it is described in \cref{theory:quantitative:principle}, with \cref{eq:theory:quantitative:area_ratio}.
AZtec too gives relative compositions, based on the elements confirmed to be present in the spectrum.
Average values for the initial quantification results are shown in \cref{tab:results:initial_quantification_stats}.
Results from all the 15 spectra are shown in \cref{tab:results:initial_quantification}, and plotted in \cref{fig:results:initial_quantification}.
% \ton{I decided to round the percentages to integers. OK?} Ok
As the table and figure show, some results are close to 50 at\%.
% TODO discuss: "Ton: Statement/observation OK, but in discussion: this is not proof for accuracy, it could be a coincident, have to consider error range. But here keep figure and comment as is"
The AZtec results are with the SEM EDS setting, if not stated otherwise.
In 12 of the 15 spectra, AZtec gives a result at 50$\pm$2 at\%.
2 of spectra are quantified at 50$\pm$4 at\%.
The 5 kV GaSb spectrum is quantified at 39:61, which is the most deviating result from AZtec.
The 5 intensity ratios from GaSb spectra with $E_0$ = 30 kV are at 50$\pm$2 at\%.
The three 15 kV results from GaSb have a deviation of $\pm$10 at\%, which show the need for closer inspection.
% TODO discuss: "Could be wrong k for that voltage, what is not correction for matrix effect"
The remaining results from the intensity ratio method produce results with higher deviations, strongly implying the need for corrections.
% The low energy results from GaAs have a high deviation, probably due to issues with overvoltage.

% TODO discuss: AZtec is pretty good, but misses at eg 5kV GaSb
% TODO discuss: the uncorrected results are good for some spectra, but others are bad. Overvoltage might be the main reason.
% TODO discuss: also comparing Ga Ka with Sb La, which should have different omega (ref to image in theory)
% TODO discuss: bulk corrections is needed

\ton{Are the next three paragraphs too much discussion? I would say no, but I am not sure.}


% What corrections are needed for the intensity ratio?
\cref{tab:results:initial_quantification} and \cref{fig:results:initial_quantification} show that the need for corrections are varying with both specimen and acquisition parameters.
% GaAs
Different $i_b$ are not affecting the correction needs much, but the $E_0$ is.
All the GaAs spectra need corrections which increase the weight of As.
AZtec have applied corrections to the GaAs spectra, where the results are pushing As too high at 5 kV and 10 kV, and not high enough at 30 kV.
The 15 kV GaAs corrections done by AZtec on GaAs is good, resulting at 50.6:49.4.
% TODO discuss: the need to increase the weight of As is due to absorption of As X-rays is Ga.
% GaSb
The trend in the GaSb spectra are not as clear as for GaAs.
The 30 kV GaSb spectra appears to require little corrections, and have good results with the intensity ratio.
The 15 kV and 10 kV spectra of GaSb need corrections to increase the weight of Sb.
The GaSb 15 kV and 10 kV spectra are quantified with Ga L$\alpha$ and Sb L$\alpha$.
% The intensity in the Sb L$\alpha$ peak in the 15 kV and 10 kV spectrum are too low, compared to the Ga L$\alpha$ peak.
AZtec have corrected the 15 kV and 10 kV compositions well.
% TODO discuss: 15 kV are slightly better than 10 kV.
% TODO discuss: the need to increase the weight of Sb. The absorption should be stronger of Ga La, so this is not the reason. Probably a Z effect. Also overvoltage. Maybe omega.


% \brynjar{TODO: Move to discussion:"Since the absorption should be stronger of the Ga L$\alpha$ peak than the Sb L$\alpha$ peak, the absorption should not be the reason for the low Sb content.
%     The low Sb content in the 15 kV and 10 kV spectra can be due to the overvoltage differences.
%     Ga L$\alpha$ has overvoltage $U = 15/1.1 = 13.6$, and Sb L$\alpha$ has $U = 15/3.6 = 4.2$ at 15 kV.
%     From the estimated ionization cross-section as a function of overvoltage, seen in \cref{fig:PAP:ionization_cross_section}, the maximum $Q(U)$ is at $U = 3.4$.
%     Thus, the overvoltage at 15 kV should not be the reason for the low Sb content.
%     % TODO discuss: the reason for the low Sb content at 15 kV is not the overvoltage, but something else.
%     The different intensities are thus probably an effect of different Z. This should be treated somewhat by the PAP method."}

Quantitative analysis of the SEM EDS bulk spectra was also done under the presumption that the specimen was a TEM specimen, i.e. under the thin film approximation.
The thin film approximation assumes no absorption of the created X-rays in the specimen, and is a part of the Cliff-Lorimer (CL) method covered in \cref{sec:theory:quantitative:k_factor_vs_k_ratio}.
The presumption that the specimen is a TEM specimen was both applied in AZtec with the "TEM setting", and in HyperSpy with the CL method.
% The TEM EDS quantification in AZtec is probably also done with the CL method, but it is not stated in the documentation.
% TODO discussion: comment that the manual does not say how the TEM quantification is done, but a blogpost says it is CL method. In addition, the setting give the k-factors, which are a part of the CL method.
TEM EDS quantification of SEM EDS data can readily be done, even though it is formally incorrect.

% the table
The results from the TEM EDS quantification routines are tabulated in \hyperref[appendix:tables]{Appendix C} in \cref{tab:results:TEM_quantification}, and average numbers from that table is presented in \cref{tab:results:TEM_quantification_stats}.
% TODO: check the appendix reference
% In \hyperref[appendix:tables]{Appendix C} (\cref{appendix:tables}), \cref{tab:appendix:mock_table}, the results are tabulated for all the spectra.
The calculated k-factors, which are extracted from AZtec and needed for the CL method in HyperSpy, are included in \cref{tab:results:TEM_quantification}.
The CL method in HyperSpy was done with and without the TEM absorption corrections, which is a part of the implemented CL quantification function.
The "CL*" column is without absorption corrections, and the "CL" column is with the TEM absorption corrections, where the $t$ is the set specimen thickness.
Six $t$ values were used: 50 nm, 100 nm, 200 nm, 400 nm, 1000 nm, and 10000 nm.
% TODO discuss: compare t with penetration depth, and argument for the very high maximum tested.


% comment on the severely poor results from GaAs at 5 kV
The GaSb spectrum at 5 kV is poorly quantified by AZtec.
AZtec is quantifying the 5 kV GaSb spectrum with the Ga L$\alpha$ and Sb M$\eta$ peaks.
Sb M$\eta$ is around 0.4 keV, and at such low energy the absorption is high, and the resulting composition is 91:9.
The Sb M$\eta$ peak is not available in HyperSpy, and no k-factor is given for the Sb L$\alpha$ line at 5 kV.
Thus, it is not possible to quantify the 5 kV GaSb spectrum with HyperSpy.
% When using TEM mode, AZtec selects the Sb M$\eta$ line at 5 kV, and as this line is not included in HyperSpy, the 5 kV GaSb spectra were not quantified in HyperSpy.
% TODO discuss: not possible to quantify with HyperSpy at 5 kV, as the Sb M$\eta$ line is missing and thus there are no k-factor for Sb La.
% TODO discuss: HyperSpy will not give k-factors, even though some people ask for it (Gitter). This is becaues that would give a high uncertainty, as the k-factors are partly dependent on the detector.
% TODO discuss from Ton: "In discussion can debate of other more correct k-factors would lead to substantial better quantification or that own k-factors can be extracted from the data you have and if that helps, even seen the wrong preassumption"


% comment on the table values
The TEM EDS quantification results of the SEM EDS data are in general deviating from the reference value of 50:50.
The average numbers for \cref{tab:results:TEM_quantification} in \cref{tab:results:TEM_quantification_stats} are calculated without the 5 kV GaSb spectra, as the 5 kV spectra were not quantified in HyperSpy.
The "TEM setting" AZtec results are deviating much more from 50:50 compared to the AZtec results using the "SEM setting", presented in \cref{results:initial_quantification}.
% TODO discuss: this celarly show that AZtec is doing different quant with SEM and TEM, but the difference is not in the documentation. We know they do XPP from the blog post, and that could have been stated in the manual.
AZtec have bigger average deviations from the reference value than HyperSpy, for all quantification methods, except when $t$ = 10000 nm.
The average AZtec deviation is 10$\pm$6 at\% from the reference value, where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the deviations from 50:50.
The CL deviations start below AZtec at the uncorrected quantification, and then the average decreases as $t$ go from 50 nm to 200 nm, and then the average deviations increase again.
The three CL quantifications closest to expected 50 at\% are with $t$ = 100 nm (7$\pm$2 at\%), $t$ = 200 nm (5$\pm$3 at\%), and $t$ = 400 nm (6$\pm$4 at\%).
The number of deviations above 10 at\% and below 5 at\% are also presented in \cref{tab:results:TEM_quantification_stats}, where 14 is the total number of spectra.
CL with $t$ = 100 nm have zero deviations above 10 at\%, but only one below 5 at\%.
CL with $t$ = 200 nm have one deviation above 10 at\%, and five below 5 at\%.
CL with $t$ = 400 nm have one deviation above 10 at\%, and four below 5 at\%.
% TODO discuss: the numbers above 10 and below 5 is nice, because the average is not the whole story. I would say t = 200 nm is the best, because it has a low average deviation, and good numbers for >10 and <5. The 200 nm also perform most similar on the GaAs and GaSb, which is important.
% TODO discuss: HyperSpy is actually better than AZtec, on TEM setting. Also, it is a special case, other specimen might have very different results.

% \ton{Now the average number table is placed here, and the result table in the appendix. Is that good? The result table is so huge that it is not easy to read.}
% TODO discuss from Ton: "What is the take-home message? (TEM approach on SEM EDS, not works well, can get some improvement in right direction by adding corrections?)" -> TEM quant with corrections can work, but what corrections should be used? Too unreliable.

\subsection{Matrix corrections}
\label{results:matrix_corrections}



\subsubsection{ZAF absorption corrections}
\label{results:matrix_corrections:ZAF}

The ZAF absorption corrections were done with \cref{eq:theory:quantitative:absorption}. %, and the results are presented in \cref{tab:results:ZAF_corrections_factors} and \cref{tab:results:ZAF_corrections_compositions}.
The calculated maximum electron range $r$ is presented in \cref{tab:results:ZAF_corrections_range_r}.
% The parameters are line, elements, $\mu_\rho$, $\rho$, $E_0$, assumed atomic fraction, TOA, and maximum electron range $t$.
To calculate the absorption correction factors, $r$ is divided by 2, 3, and 4 to get different approximations for the average depth of origin of the X-rays.
The calculated absorption correction factors are presented in \cref{tab:results:ZAF_corrections_factors}.
The corrected compositions are presented in \cref{tab:results:ZAF_corrections_compositions}.
Average numbers for the compositions are given in \cref{tab:results:ZAF_corrections_compositions_stats}.

% \ton{Should I drop the GaSb absorption corrections? They only make the results worse.}
% answer: It is case dependent and therefore combining can give odd results. Would not take things out. To do it GaAs/GaSb is not many numbers to do statistics and number of spectra taken is not objective parameter. Think what you want to discus and conclude based on this part. 

% \ton{Should I also have average etc. here? For GaSb the results are bad (does not need the absorption correction), but for GaAs the results are improved.}
% answer: that seems to be general impression. Is the average make that more solid observation?

% \ton{TODO: the densities are not the same as stated on Wikipedia.}
% answer: Where is wiki based on? Can you calculate it yourself or use a reference physics work as Handbook of Physics and Chemistry?

% TODO discuss: my model is not reality. I had a bug for the range r, and when i fixed in the GaAs quantification was actually deviating more.

\subsubsection{XPP/PAP corrections}
\label{results:matrix_corrections:XPP}

% The correction factors calculated with XPP are presented in \cref{tab:results:XPP_corrections_factors}.
% These correction factors were calculated with the XPP/PAP notebook, which is in \hyperref[appendix:xpp]{Appendix B}.


The XPP/PAP corrections were done in two ways, where the measured intensity of a peak $I_A$ is divided by the calculated generated intensity of the peak $F$ or by the calculated XPP absorption correction factor $f(\chi)$.
Both ways are presented in \cref{tab:results:XPP_compositions}, where the uncorrected compositions are included for comparison.
All compositions are in atomic percent, and are calculated with the relative peak area method.
Average numbers for the XPP corrections are given in \cref{tab:results:XPP_compositions_stats}.
$F$ and $f(\chi)$ are calculated with the XPP/PAP notebook, and are dependent on $E_0$, $E_C$ of the line, and the elements with their weight fraction of the elements.
The elements and their weight fractions are used to calculate the density $\rho$, the mean atomic mass $M$, the mean ionization potential $J$, the mean atomic number $\bar{Z}$, the backscattering coefficient $R$, and $\mu_\rho$ of the line at $E_0$.
The weight fractions used in the calculations are set to the equivalent of a 50:50 atomic percent composition, as this should give the best possible correction factors.
A finished product for XPP bulk corrections should have iterative calculations of the weight fractions, but these results are aiming to demonstrate the possible usefulness of XPP corrections, thus the best available input parameters are used.

% TODO discuss: add Fig 19.14 p.305 from Goldstein with F and F(chi) to illustrate why the chosen corrections were used.
% TODO discuss: the XPP corrections make the results slightly better, but it is far from a finished results. Probably both a problem with the interpretation and the implementation of the XPP bulk corrections in the notebook. This can be investigated further, and the advice is to start with ...



% TODO discuss: føles ikke perfekt, men er et steg i riktig retning. Sub tings kan jeg plotte, men det er mange likninger som kan være litt feil. Små feil i koden eller i parameters som rho eller mu kan gi store utslag.
% TODO discuss: selge at jeg har skrevet teori og implementeri i kode, selge det.


% \input{tables/results/table_XPP_compositions.tex} % Is now in the appendix
\input{tables/results/table_XPP_compositions_stats.tex}





% TODO discuss from Ton: "You have such table for initial, ZAF (different conditions) and PAP. Put all in one Table to see what approach looks most promising? What conclusion/advice based on all these numbers is emerging? There are several sub-conclusions and the conclsuion could be that one is totally wrong (and cannot be corrected) and other is going towards correct direction, but needs refinement or a loop??????????"
