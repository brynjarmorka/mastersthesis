This master's thesis is the final part of my master's degree in nanotechnology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).
The work explores the realm of SEM EDS analysis and focuses on enhancing its quantitative capabilities through open-source software.
The thesis builds upon my previous work on similar topics conducted in autumn 2022 and represents a focused and dedicated effort from January to June. % to delve deeper into the realm of SEM EDS analysis.

I am grateful to my supervisor Professor Antonius T. J. van Helvoort for his guidance and enthusiasm throughout the project.
The Research Council of Norway is acknowledged for the support to the Norwegian Micro- and Nano-Fabrication Facility, NorFab, project number 295864.

May this thesis contribute to the field of SEM EDS analysis.
