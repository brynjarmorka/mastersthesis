\section{Regarding the ISO 15632 standard}
\label{theory:eds_performance:iso15632}

BAM (Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing) has a test sample for SEM EDS with a accompanying software, which satisfies the ISO 15632 standard.
However, the price per 28.02.2023 for this sample (EDS TM002) is 334 EUR and 335 EUR for the software.
A full test in accordance with the ISO standard could probably be done with a cheaper sample and a Jupyter Notebook, where the user would see all the steps and the results.
This has not been a main focus in this work, but some parameters in the ISO standard are covered in this work.
