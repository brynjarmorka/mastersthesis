            Output count rate, OCR            & The actual number of counts registered and outputted to the memory. The OCR is lower than the ICR because of the dead time, and because the OCR includes coincidence events.                                               \\
            Throughput                        & How much information a system can process per units of time. In EDS the throughput is the OCR.                                                                                                                             \\

            Dead time                         & The amount of time when the input to the electronics is shut off, because an analouge voltage signals is being converted to a digital count. Dead time is both expressed in seconds and as a percentage of the real time.  \\
            Live time                         & The time in seconds when the detector is actively registering counts.                                                                                                                                                      \\
            Process time                      & A system setting for how much time the electronics have to convert the voltage signal. Longer times give more accurate assessment of the energy. The process time is a trade-off between throughput and energy resolution. \\
            Dwell time                        & The time the electron beam is on each pixel in the 2D image. Higher times increase signal intensities and spatial resolution, but can introduce issues.                                                                    \\
