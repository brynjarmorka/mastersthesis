        The estimated FWHM of Mn K$\alpha$ with different reference lines.
        When using 'all\_alpha', the alphabetically first line is used as reference.
        That is, for 30 and 15 kV, As K$\alpha$ is used as reference.
        For 10 and 5 kV, As L$\alpha$ is used as reference.
        The original resolution is from the instrument software.
