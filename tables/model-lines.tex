    \caption{
        The lines in the HyperSpy models for the GaAs sample, when As and Ga are added as elements.
        The dashed lines are the lines that are not used in the model, because of low overvoltage.
        HyperSpy differentiates between "X-ray lines" and "Family lines", where the first are the alpha lines of the element.
